      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Objective - project info</h4>
      <p>This project focuses on developing a new design or redesign for creating a case on Dr. Hud's website. The entire design was to be revamped, including colors, buttons, layout placement, etc. This was done because the mobile version has been prioritized, but they have observed that users log in on desktop but do not complete a case on desktop, it was lacking a “feeling” and did not look like the mobile version.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Goals</h4>
      <p>The goal is to produce a new desktop design that focuses on usability and is implemented in production.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Project development</h4>
      <p>This project lasted for a month and a half, where phase one involved a significant portion of methodology and qualitative research approach.
       Phase one included methods like:
       <ul>
        <li>Usability test/interview</li>
        <li>Competitor analys</li>
        <li>WCAG analys</li>
        <li>Affinity mapping</li>
        <li>Personas </li>
        <li>Impact/effort mapping</li>
       </ul>
       In phase two, I was able to develop wireframes for testing, and then prototype them. The project was divided into three weeks for phase one and three weeks for phase two, as the design evolves based on feedback from the product owner over time.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Final deliverables</h4>
      <p>Because this project was significant, I had two deliverables for the research part and one for the design implementation. Regarding the research, I compiled a report on the identified problems and necessary fixes. I prioritized user stories using an impact/effort map and delivered a report on what and why I should focus on certain areas. Another deliverable was the design sketches based on the research. I created sketches for the summary page, the dashboard, and the patient open case view, as these views required completely new designs. For the design implementation, I created both wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes for all the flows. Some changes were applied to all views based on the research results. I decided to center all content on the page to ensure a good margin around the content. Additionally, I designed three completely new pages: the summary/checkout page, the start page, and the open patient case view.
        The design was tested first with the team and then with six users, and I compiled a report for the team. The handover of design files and concepts was completed after several meetings with the development team.</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Summary</h4>
        <p>The desktop project was exciting. The research part was challenging because I received a lot of feedback from both users and the team. The difficulty lied in prioritizing, as I needed to balance user needs with Dr hud's core metrics and the desires of other stakeholders. In the design phase, the challenge was to effectively communicate my design choices to the team so they could understand the rationale behind them. The most rewarding part was when they agreed with my decisions and were eager to start the implementation as soon as possible.</p>

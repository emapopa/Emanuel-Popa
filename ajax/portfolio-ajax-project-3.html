      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Objective - project info</h4>
      <p>The project aims to carefully evaluate the current process of questioning patients regarding the identification and differentiation of moles and skin cancer. By reviewing and analyzing existing research and competitors' practices in the field, we aim to identify any shortcomings or inefficiencies in our questioning flow. Through meticulous assessment of the effectiveness and accuracy of the questions we pose, we seek to enhance both the quality of our care and the diagnostic process for our patients. Any adjustments to the questioning flow will be based on evidence-based research and insights from competitor analysis, enabling a more robust and precise method for distinguishing between harmless moles and potentially dangerous skin changes indicative of cancer. By implementing these improvements, we strive not only to enhance our ability to detect and treat skin cancer early but also to increase physicians' confidence in the diagnostic tools we provide and ensure that patients receive the best possible care and treatment.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Goals</h4>
      <p>The project goal is to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the questions we ask patients to distinguish between moles and skin cancer. Based on research and competitor analysis, adjustments to the questioning flow may be necessary.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Project development</h4>
      <p>
        This project took one month to complete and had four phases:
       <ul>
        <li>Understanding - This phase focuses on grasping doctors' assessment needs, analyzing methods like the "ABCDE" and "ugly duckling" methods. I will also explore potential diagnostic errors and strategies to prevent misunderstandings.</li>
        <li>Analysis - Here, I will study how other clinics handle similar cases, comparing their questions to improve our approach and draw inspiration. Competitor responses will be categorized using the ABCDE method to identify areas for enhancement.</li>
        <li>Formulation - Solutions and recommendations will be crafted based on competitor analysis and medical research, with periodic check-ins with the manager.</li>
        <li>Summary and Presentation - summarizing my steps and incorporating feedback from medical professionals, I aim to gain a comprehensive view of the process. A report detailing findings and suggestions will be presented to the team or stakeholders.</li>
       </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Final deliverables</h4>
      <p>This project had one deliverable that we can divide into two parts. The first part involved research and benchmarking, which was essential for understanding how doctors diagnose birthmarks and what kind of information they require (I studied the ABCDE method and the 'ugly duckling' concept). Then, I compared 12 competitors and almost 80 questions. With the help of AI, I sorted these questions into categories: ABCDE, Ugly Duckling, Patient Profile, Allergies, and Patient Medical History.
        In the second part, based on my research and these categories, I created a new flow with new questions. The challenging aspect was to gather a lot of information without asking too many questions, and this took some time. However, now Dr. Hud has the most complex and shortest formula compared to our competitors. All the questions and the new flows were approved by the doctors we work with</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Summary</h4>
        <p>This was one of the most complex projects I've worked on because I needed to deeply understand the differences between a birthmark and skin cancer in order to create a new flow for the patient. Another concerning aspect was that, based on my flow, doctors were able to understand the patient's situations. It's been several months since the new flow was implemented, and I've noticed a consistent drop in follow-up questions due to the more medically inclusive flow.</p>

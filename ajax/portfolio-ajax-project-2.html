      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Objective - project info</h4>
      <p>For this project, the current options lack clarity and user-friendliness. To improve this, I plan to introduce a more intuitive flow with empowering choices for patients. Patients can initiate new cases seamlessly, streamlining the process for additional inquiries. They'll also have direct contact with their doctor for personalized support. Additionally, patients can set reminders for future check-ups, promoting proactive healthcare management. These changes aim to enhance the user experience and improve healthcare outcomes. </p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Goals</h4>
      <p>The goal is to improve the user experience within the open case section for the patient's perspective, particularly focusing on patients interactions with their doctors responses.</p>

        <li>Gather the requirements for the project</li>
        <li>Research and benchmark</li>
        <li>New flow suggestions</li>

        <li>Prototype </li>
        <li>Testing</li>
       </ul>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Final deliverables</h4>
      <p>This project has two major deliverables. The first one was to find a new flow for the open case view and answer some questions like: How are they going to see their old cases? How are they going to see the current case? How are they going to see the doctor's answer? How can they respond to the doctor? How can they contact support and provide feedback on the case? Those were the primary questions, and I developed a new flow based on that. The second deliverable was more challenging because the person in charge of this project doesn't know anything about UX and UI. It took 20 different design flows to create a final design that we both agreed on.
        The final product was divided into three parts. The first view displays all the cases, the second view allows you to view one case, and the third view provides more information about that case and which doctor you are talking to.</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Summary</h4>
        <p>This was a challenging project. One of the requirements was that the UI must resemble a messenger app more closely. However, the problem was that the patient doesn't have the capability to initiate communication with the doctor; they can only respond if the doctor asks for more information. So, I could say that the project question was, How can i implement a messenger UI design without making the patient inclined to message the doctors (because it's not possible)? The only thing I can say is that it took me 20 different design flows to find the answer, but I succeeded in finding one that both agreed on. </p>

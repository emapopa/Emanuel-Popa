      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Objective - project info</h4>
      <p>Dr. Hud wanted to highlight more articles on its website while ensuring that the articles were SEO optimized for the best results. This was achieved by reviewing existing articles and using the Semrush program to achieve the best possible SEO analysis. The goal was to develop 20 new articles, which would then be uploaded to the website. This endeavor involves striving to increase the number of visitors who take desired actions, such as reading articles and engaging with the website. By optimizing the content and improving visibility on search engines like Google, we aim to attract more users to Dr. Hud's website while also expanding the overall content in the article repository.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Goals</h4>
      <p>The project goal is to increase conversion for articles in Google search engines and simultaneously expand Dr. Hud's article repository. </p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Project development</h4>
      <p>
       <ul>
        <li>During the first week, research was conducted on SEO, including which tools are best to use, how to craft the best possible article, and how to describe a headline, as well as which keywords to use.</li>
        <li>In the first week, we also conducted a benchmark analysis to see how they write their articles and what types of articles they write.</li>
        <li>During the second week, the articles were created, and each article underwent a SEO review.</li>
       </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Final deliverables</h4>
      <p>In those two weeks, I created 15 new articles and optimized 6 more. I also developed guidelines on how those articles should be crafted in the future. Since Dr. Hud's company utilizes Contentful as a tool for writing articles, the issue arises because Contentful is headless, resulting in articles lacking meta descriptions and titles. My solution was to introduce two new fields to those articles (metatitle and metadescription). Although these fields won't be visible on the articles, the frontend team will rectify them, as these fields serve as meta tags with vital information. Additionally, I utilized Semrush to ensure the content is SEO compliant. Another action I took was adding a “Read More” section and linking two more articles from a Swedish company and one from an American one. These links are intended to boost the SEO score. Following feedback from the team, I made some minor adjustments and submitted them to the doctors for review. Now, the articles are live on the Dr. Hud webpage.

        – The next step is to implement a table of contents and a section with information about Dr. Hud, including a CTA button to start a consultation on the article side. This was not a priority, but will be added in the near future</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Summary</h4>
        <p>Dr. Hud aimed to increase article visibility on their website while optimizing them for SEO. Through Semrush analysis, 20 new articles were developed and uploaded, aiming to attract more visitors and improve engagement. Research on SEO tools and article crafting was conducted in the first week, followed by article creation and SEO review in the second week. The final deliverables include 15 new articles, optimized existing ones, and guidelines for future articles. Additionally, metaTitle and metaDescription fields were added for better SEO, and a "read more" section linked to relevant articles. After team feedback and doctor review, the articles are now live on the Dr. Hud webpage.</p>

      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Objective - project info</h4>
      <p>This project approach aims to enhance user experience by simplifying the process of inputting data regarding
        moles' characteristics and locations. By enabling users to upload multiple images, the new design promotes
        comprehensive documentation, potentially improving the accuracy of mole assessments. Additionally, the feature
        to seamlessly input information without restarting the application enhances efficiency, saving users time and
        effort. This user-centric approach underscores the commitment to enhancing accessibility and usability,
        ultimately contributing to more effective mole tracking and monitoring for better healthcare outcomes.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Goals</h4>
      <p>The project goal is to develop a new design where users can upload multiple images and provide information
        about moles without having to restart the application.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Project development</h4>
      <p>
        This project lasted for a month, where phase one involved a significant portion of methodology and qualitative
        research approach.

        Phase one included methods like:
      <ul>
        <li>Competitor analysis</li>
        <li>Research </li>
        <li>Flowchart </li>
        <li>Wireframes </li>
        <li>Prototype </li>

      </ul>
      During phase two, I progressed from the initial wireframes to fully functional prototypes, marking a significant
      advancement in the project development. Building upon the conceptual framework established in the wireframing
      stage, I translated abstract ideas into tangible, interactive models that accurately reflected the intended user
      experience. This transition involved refining design elements, incorporating feedback, and addressing potential
      usability issues identified during testing. By iteratively refining the prototypes, I was able to fine-tune the
      user interface, streamline navigation pathways, and enhance overall usability.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Final deliverables</h4>
      <p>The project has two major deliverables. The first one is to establish a new flow that allows the patient to
        send multiple birthmarks to the dermatologist without having to redo many steps. After conducting research and
        benchmarking, I developed two new flows. Following a workshop with the team, we decided which flow to implement.
        The second deliverable was to create a new design flow and ensure that the user is guided through the entire
        process. It took several rounds of feedback, but the new flow is now up and running smoothly.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600">Summary</h4>
      <p>To ensure the user experience is as easy as possible, I made several decisions:
      <ul>
        <li>Users will select the location of birthmarks on a body map.</li>
        <li>Users will answer all questions before uploading images.</li>
        <li>Users will be able to upload more birthmarks after uploading images. </li>
        <li>Users will only answer specific questions when adding additional birthmarks.</li>
        <li>Users won't need to answer generic questions again when adding extra birthmarks, as they've already done so.
        </li>

      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      These decisions were made to provide users with a logical and easy way to upload multiple birthmarks. The project
      is based on research conducted through due diligence, benchmarking competitors, and studying medical
      records/sites.
      Summary Page Changes:
      <ul>
        <li>Users should be able to view all the different birthmarks.</li>
        <li>Users should see all their answers prepopulated in a field.</li>
        <li>Users should be able to edit and delete those answers. </li>
        <li>Users should be able to delete birthmarks by clicking on the button at the bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Users should not be able to return to the flow once they reach the summary page.</li>
        <li>Users should not be able to change the skin disease.</li>
        <li>Users should not be able to change the position of their birthmarks.</li>
        <li>Users should not be able to change or delete the pictures.</li>


      </ul>
      These decisions were made to allow users the possibility to change and delete birthmarks before checkout.
      </p>
